## Phases

### ✅ v1.4 Content Expansion (Complete)

**Milestone Goal:** Expand game content with data-driven tile system, 9 tile types, 7x7 boards, and 10 new levels.

#### Phase 23: Tile System Refactor

**Goal:** Tile types are data-driven and all 9 tile types render correctly

**Depends on:** Phase 22

**Requirements:** TSYS-01, TSYS-02, TSYS-03

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Tile types are defined in a single configuration source (no hardcoded type literals in game logic)
2. Adding or removing a tile type requires only config changes (no changes to type unions or switch statements)
3. All 9 tile types (burger, coffee, fuel_can, hotdog, oil, snack, soda, water, wheel) render correctly with their sprites
4. Board spawning and matching logic work with all 9 configured tile types

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 23-01-PLAN.md — Create tile config system and refactor types/constants/engine
- [x] 23-02-PLAN.md — Wire up 9 tile assets, clean Game.ts casts, update tests

---

#### Phase 24: 7x7 Board Transition

**Goal:** All levels use 7x7 boards with adjusted goals and moves

**Depends on:** Phase 23

**Requirements:** BOARD-01, BOARD-02

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Game engine uses 7x7 grid dimensions (not 8x8)
2. All existing levels L1-L10 are retrofitted to 7x7 boards
3. Retrofitted levels have adjusted goals and move counts balanced for smaller board
4. Retrofitted levels remain winnable with similar difficulty

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 24-01-PLAN.md — Update engine constants and tests to 7x7
- [x] 24-02-PLAN.md — Retrofit L1-L10 level JSONs to 7x7

---

#### Phase 25: New Levels

**Goal:** 10 new levels with progressive difficulty using all tile types

**Depends on:** Phase 24

**Requirements:** LVL-01, LVL-02, LVL-03, LVL-04

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. 10 new levels (L11-L20) exist with 7x7 boards
2. New levels use all 9 tile types in level configurations
3. New levels introduce progressive difficulty through more obstacles, harder goals, and fewer moves
4. Level select map displays all 20 level nodes with correct positioning on Kyiv map
5. User can play through all new levels and progress is tracked correctly

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 25-01-PLAN.md — Create L11-L20 level JSONs with progressive difficulty and all 9 tile types
- [x] 25-02-PLAN.md — Extend level select map, Boot loader, and navigation for 20 levels
